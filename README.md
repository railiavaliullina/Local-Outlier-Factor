# Local-Outlier-Factor
## About The Project

1) Implementation of Local Outlier Factor (LOF) algorithm for anomaly detection task,
2) Implementation of the following metrics:

    - Average precision,
    
    - F1-score,
    
    - Confusion matrix.
  
3) data visualization (using Plotly),

4) searching for k, which gives the best average precision,

5) building a precision-recall curve,

6) searching for the best F1-score, 

7) building a confusion matrix for a given threshold.
